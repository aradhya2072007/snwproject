        The history of cocktails dates back to the 19th century, with the term "cocktail" first appearing in print around 1806. From simple mixtures to elaborate creations, cocktails have evolved into a global phenomenon. Remember, the key to a great cocktail is balance: the right ratio of sweet, sour, bitter, and strong elements.</p>

        <h2 class="tab-h2">
            Essential Tools:
        </h2>

        <ul class="sec-ul">
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Cocktail Shaker:</strong> For chilling and diluting drinks, a Boston (two-piece) or Cobbler (three-piece) shaker is necessary.</li>
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Jigger:</strong> For accurate measurement. The majority have sides that are 1 oz, 2 oz or smaller.</li>
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Hawthorne Strainer: </strong>Used to strain ice and muddled ingredients when combined with a Boston shaker.</li>
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Fine-Mesh Strainer:</strong>For "Double Straining" in order to get rid of fruit pulp or tiny ice chips.</li>
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Muddler:</strong> A pestle made of wood or steel that is used to crush sugar, fruits, and herbs like mint.</li>
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Bar Spoon: </strong> A long-handled spoon for stirring drinks like the Old Fashioned.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tab-h2">
            Key Techniques:
        </h2>

        <ul class="sec-ul">
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Shaking:</strong>For 10 to 15 seconds, shake the ingredients (usually citrus or egg white) with ice very hard. This cools, thins, and adds air to the drink.</li>
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Stirring:</strong>To chill and dilute without adding air, gently stir ingredients (usually spirits-forward drinks like an Old Fashioned or Martini) with ice.</li>
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Muddleding:</strong>Gently press on herbs or fruit to release their oils and juices. Don't pulverize them!</li>
            <li class="tab-p"> <strong>Straining:</strong>Pouring the liquid from the shaker into the glass, leaving the ice and solids behind.</li>
        </ul>
